- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a final-year Statistical Science student at University College London.

- ðŸŒ± Alongside learning data science and machine learning as part of my course, I have actively sought opportunities to gain real-world exposure to the application of technology and data in industry. Through spring and summer internships, I have built a solid foundation in **Python, SQL, relational databases, and YAML configuration files**, and gained familiarity with **JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Django web development framework**. I am also proficient in using the **Requests** library to download data via API endpoints and in using **Selenium** automation to ethically scrape data from websites.

- ðŸ’¼ My industry experience includes interning as a **data engineer** aligned with the **Commodities and Global Markets** business, which broadened my skillset in data analytics workflows and **DevOps (where I worked extensively with Kubernetes and cloud deployments involving EKS, Argo Workflows, and ArgoCD)**. I also engaged directly with clients and business analysts, where I developed an understanding of various assets in the **commodities, fixed income, and FX markets**. My attention to detail was commended as excellent when I clarified requirements with clients to ensure the data pipeline I was building delivered exactly what they needed.

- ðŸ’» Exposure to **high-frequency and low-latency trading systems** at proprietary trading firms also inspired me to appreciate the advantages of using **C++** in specific application scenarios.

- ðŸ“– Other interesting modules I have taken as part of my degree include **Computational Statistics, Stochastic Methods in Finance, Algorithms and Data Structures, Optimisation, Applied Multivariate and High-Dimensional Methods, Time-Series Forecasting, Bayesian Statistics**, as well as more theoretical courses such as **Mathematical Analysis and Advanced Linear Algebra**.

- ðŸ‘¯ My hobbies: Choir Singing, Yoga, and Painting

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
