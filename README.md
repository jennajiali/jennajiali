- ðŸŽ“ Iâ€™m a final-year Statistical Science student at University College London

- ðŸŒ± As well as learning data science and machine learning as part of my course, I have actively sought opportunities to gain real-world exposure to the application of technology and data in the industry. Through Spring and Summer Internships, I have developed a solid foundation working with Python, SQL & relational databases, and YAML configuration files, and familiarity with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and the Django web development framework. I'm proficient in using the Request library to download data via API endpoint, as well as using Selenium automation to ethically scrape data from a website. 

- ðŸ’¼ The industry exposure I had, such as interning as a data engineer aligned with the Commodities and Global Markets business, broadened my skillset in data analytics workflows and DevOps (where I dived deep into Kubernetes, EKS, ArgoWF, ArgoCD). It also allowed me to talk directly with the clients and business analysts, and through such experience, I was able to pick up finance terminologies and knowledge about various assets' features in the commodities, fixed income, and FX markets. My attention to detail was commended as excellent when I carefully clarified and understood the requirements with the client to make sure the data pipeline I was building was delivering the exact input data they needed. 

- ðŸ’» Gaining insight into the high-frequency and low-latency trading system used at proprietary trading companies also inspired me regarding the advantages of using C++ in certain application scenarios, and I'm currently learning C++ as part of being an avid learner on freeCodeCamp.

- ðŸ“– Other interesting modules I have as part of my degree include: Computational Statistics, Stochastic Methods in Finance, Algorithm and Data Structures, Optimisation, Applied Multivariate and High Dimensional Methods, Time-Series Forecasting, Bayesian Statistics, and the maths ones like Mathematical Analysis and Advanced Linear Algebra. 

- ðŸ‘¯ My hobbies: Choir Singing, Yoga, and Painting

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/Her
